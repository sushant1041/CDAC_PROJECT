    1) what is spring boot ?
    ==> - Spring boot is a framework for building application in the java programming language
          - Spring Boot makes it easy to create standalone , production grade spring based application that you can just run.

    2)  why use spring boot over spring ?
   ==> - the core spring framework already reduces boilerplate code and provides a lot of helpful features for java applications.
          - However , Spring Boot takes this convenience to the next level by focusing specially on reducing the effort required to set up and configure a spring application.
          - while Spring does simplify many tasks like creating web applications, working with databases , managing transactions and more , but setting up a spring project can still involve quite a bit of manual configuration
     
* Spring Boot Provides Auto-Configuration , Standalone Application    

* When we create an api we need to manually set up the spring application context in the main method then it become easier when we use the @SpringBootApplication Annotation on the main class . this Single annotation replaces the need for setting up a manual Spring ApplicationContext(Class).      

3) Why we use @SpringBootApplication ?
==> the @SpringBootApplication annotation alone brings in a lot pre-configured feature , including automatic component scanning and embedded server configuration , which would have required more steps in a traditional spring setup.
